# Call for Position Papers and Participation in the Challenge

We are soliciting two kinds of contributions from the community:

#### Participation in the replicability challenge and related "docker paper"

  We solicit participants who would be willing to contribute Docker images that encapsulate strong baselines as well as state-of-the-art techniques: examples include runs based on query expansion, entity annotations, and neural networks. In particular, we are actively soliciting involvement from researchers working on neural IR.
  
  Tentatively, our initial focus will be on newswire collections (since they are smaller and more manageable).

 These Docker images have to be accompanied by a paper describing the experience of a team in participating to the challenge.
  
#### Position papers

  We solicit perspective authors to submit position papers around the issues of replicability in the IR field, with a special focus on infrastructures to enable them.
  
  The goal of these papers is to further stimulate the discussion at the workshop and help shaping the path forward for the community.

All the papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.

All the accepted papers, both position and docker images papers, will be included in the OSIRRC 2019 proceedings in the [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](http://ceur-ws.org/) series, indexed by DBLP, Google Scholar, Scopus and others.

All the accepted papers will be given a presentation slot during the workshop.


# Paper Submission Guidelines

We invite submissions of:

* docker papers (up to 8 pages): describing the participation in the OSIRRC challenge; these papers can be submitted only by teams which have also submitted docker images

* position papers (up to 4 pages): discussing replicability and reproducibility challenges in IR,  with a special focus on infrastructures enabling them;

Submissions must be in English, in PDF format, and must use standard ACM SIGIR templates, available at [http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) for both LaTeX and Word. 

Papers must report work that is not previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not currently under review elsewhere.

Papers should be submitted electronically conference submission system at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=osirrc2019](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=osirrc2019)
